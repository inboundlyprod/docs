To access your API key, go to the Settings tab and select "Integrations" from the left sidebar.

<Info>To protect the privacy of your workspace data, please securely store your API key. Anyone with your API key can retrieve information about your workspace leads. As our Zapier integration expands in the future, the API key will be able to access even more information than it does now.</Info>

To generate a new API key, click "Generate new API key".

<Warning>All integrations using a previous API key will no longer work. You'll need to update your integrations with the new API key.</Warning>
