In your inbox, type the forward slash "/" in the message box to access your quick replies (for the current inbox). Use the arrow keys or mouse to navigate between your quick replies.

As you continue typing, the options will narrow down to match your input.

Once you've selected the desired quick reply, either press the Enter key (â†µ) when your desired quick reply is highlighted gray or click with your cursor to fill the message box.
