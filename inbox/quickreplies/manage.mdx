By effectively leveraging quick replies, you can save time and have consistent responses.

## Creating a Quick Reply

Navigate to the Settings tab and access the Quick Replies section using the left sidebar. Click on the "Create" button to begin creating a new quick reply.

First, choose which inboxes will have access to this quick reply. This allows you to customize quick replies for specific inboxes. For example, if you have different Calendly links for different inboxes, then each inbox could have their own **/calendly** command.

Create a **command**, which is what you will later type in the message bar to trigger the quick reply.

Provide a **description** to help you remember the purpose of the quick reply.

Enter the **reply text**, which is the actual message that will be sent when using the quick reply. Emojis and line breaks are supported!

## Editing a Quick Reply

Go to the Settings tab and access the Quick Replies section using the left sidebar.

You'll see a List of all your quick replies for the current inbox, or you can also search by commands. Click on the three dots next to the quick reply you wish to edit. Select "Edit Reply" to make changes to the details of the quick reply.

You can modify the command, description, reply text, and the associated inboxes. Any changes made will apply immediately to all inboxes associated with the command.
