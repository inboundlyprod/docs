This will remove the user from your inbox, delete the lead associated with them, and ignore any future messages from this user.

If you need to unblock a user, go to the Settings tab and access the General Workspace settings using the left sidebar. From there, click on "Blocked Users" to view the List of users you have blocked. Select the user (or users) you wish to unblock and click "Unblock" to remove them from the blocked List. This action will allow new messages from the unblocked user to be added to your Inbox and CRM again.
