Opportunity Scores help you prioritize and focus on leads with the highest potential for conversion.

Inboundly analyzes all received messages to determine a score for each lead, indicating how interested the lead may be, how likely they are to close, and how positively they react.

<Info>Messages that **you send** do not affect a lead's opportunity score.</Info>

To view a user's opportunity score, either:
* Navigate to the conversation in your Inbox
* Navigate to the conversation in Lists
* Navigate to the conversation in your CRM
* View leads' opportunity scores directly in your pipeline on labels with the type "Opportunity Score" (learn more [here](/crm/labels/create))
