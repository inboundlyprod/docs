## Creating Follow-Up Reminders

To create a follow-up reminder, navigate to the conversation with the lead (either through the Inbox, or by clicking on a lead in your CRM or Lists).

In the top bar, simply click the blue reminder button. From there, select your preferred reminder timeframe from the available options, then hit "Save".

## Updating Follow-Up Reminders

To update an existing follow-up reminder, navigate to the conversation with the lead (either through the Inbox, or by clicking on a lead in your CRM or Lists).

<video autoplay="true" muted="true" loop playsinline className="w-full aspect-video" src="/videos/guides_edit_reminder.mp4" />
In the top bar, simply click the blue reminder button. From there, pick a new date and hit "Save", or cancel the reminder.
