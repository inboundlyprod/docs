By assigning leads to CRM labels, you can categorize and organize them based on their status, without needing to go to the CRM tab to move them.

To update a lead's label, navigate to the conversation with the lead (either through the Inbox, or by clicking on a lead in your CRM or Lists).

In the sidebar, simply update their label, and the changes will be auto-saved.
