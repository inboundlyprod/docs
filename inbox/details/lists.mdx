By organizing leads into lists, you can effectively manage and categorize your leads based on specific criteria.

To add or edit contact info, navigate to the conversation with the lead (either through the Inbox, or by clicking on a lead in your CRM or Lists).

In the sidebar, simply add or remove the lead from lists directly, and the changes will be auto-saved.
