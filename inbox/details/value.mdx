<Info>By default, every lead's value is set to the CRM-level [default lead value](/crm/default-value), which can be changed in your CRM settings.</Info>

To update a lead's value, navigate to the conversation with the lead (either through the Inbox, or by clicking on a lead in your CRM or Lists).

In the sidebar, simply fill in or edit the desired value directly into the input bar. Your changes will auto-save as you type, so you can move extremely quickly.
