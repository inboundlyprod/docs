Navigate to the top left corner of the inbox to see the filtering options.

For basic filtering, you can easily switch between viewing all messages, unread messages, or follow-up messages.

By default, the inbox is sorted by the latest message, ensuring you see the most recent interactions first. To search for a specific conversation, simply type the name of the lead into the search bar.

Here's what each filter means:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Current Label">Selecting a label here will display messages only from leads with that label. Choosing multiple labels will show messages from leads with either label.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lists">If you've created a list, you can filter to only show messages from leads that are members of specific lists. Choosing multiple lists will show messages from leads in either list.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reply Sent">Filter messages to display only those where you replied last, helping you stay on top of ongoing conversations.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Reply Sent">This filter shows messages where the lead messaged last, showing conversions that need your attention.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Last Interaction">Choose from past 24 hours, past 7 days, or past 30 days to filter conversations based on the time of the last interaction.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>Filters can be combined to refine your search even further. For example, selecting both a specific label and a timeframe will narrow down results to messages that match **both** criteria.</Tip>
