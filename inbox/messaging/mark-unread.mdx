<Info>Marking messages as unread within Inboundly does not affect  X/Twitter in any way. You can read the message within Inboundly without sending a "read receipt" on  X/Twitter.</Info>

To mark a conversation as unread, click the gear icon located within the conversation to access message options. Within the options menu, select "Mark as Unread" to designate the conversation as unread.

<video autoplay="true" muted="true" loop playsinline className="w-full aspect-video" src="/videos/guides_mark_unread.mp4" />

Now, this conversation will appear as if it has not been read, allowing you to easily identify messages you want to revisit later.

In Inboundly, opening a message will automatically mark it as read. Therefore, remember to mark a message as unread if you wish to maintain its unread status for future reference.
