## Connecting Your Inbox

To start turning DM's into deals, you will need to first connect an  𝕏/Twitter account to Inboundly.

First, log in to an  𝕏/Twitter account on the same device and browser you're using to set up Inboundly.

If you're logged in to multiple  𝕏/Twitter accounts already, make sure to switch to the one that you want to connect to Inboundly.

Back on Inboundly, you'll see a big "Connect Inbox" popup - click the button and then "Authorize app" on the next page.

That's it! Once Inboundly is done importing your inbox, you're completely set up and ready to go.

## Sending Messages

<Note>For more efficient messaging, check out our [quick replies](/inbox/quickreplies) guide.</Note>

Effortlessly communicate with leads by sending messages from your inbox.

Head over to the Inbox tab and click to open a conversation.

Type your message within the message field, then simply click "Send". However, keep in mind that when sending messages, you will need to click "Send" again on  𝕏/Twitter due to API limits. Stay tuned for the upcoming update, we're working on adding one-click sending.

## Scheduling Follow-Ups

<Note>For more advanced follow-up details, refer to our [follow-ups](/inbox/reminders) guide.</Note>

Timely follow-ups can make all the difference in nurturing leads and closing deals.

To stay on top of your leads, open a conversation, and click the blue button with the bell icon.

Select your preferred time frame for the follow-up reminder. For example, choose "1 week" to receive a reminder in precisely one week.

This proactive approach ensures you never miss an opportunity to follow up with a lead.

## Moving Leads Through Your Pipeline

It's time to set up your  𝕏/Twitter CRM! Streamline your lead management process by seamlessly moving leads through a custom pipeline in seconds.

First, go to the CRM tab, then click "Create label" and give your label a descriptive name. For example, "Interested", "Meeting Booked" or any other stage of your sales funnel.

Once you've named the label, click "Create". Now, you can drag and drop leads to the desired stage in the pipeline. For instance, move a lead from "Engaged" to "Interested".

You can also click on leads to open your conversation with them! This intuitive process keeps your pipeline organized.

## Adding Leads to Lists

<Note>Looking to take your lead organization to the next level? Explore our guide on [auto-segmentation](/lists/auto-segment) to automatically add leads to lists based on predefined criteria.</Note>

You can organize your leads further by creating custom lists (i.e. segments, tags, etc.) tailored to your conversion goals.

To begin, head to the Lists tab and click "Create List".

Name your List according to its purpose, such as "Interested in Paid Community" and add a tag for easy identification (e.g., tag = "paid-community"). Once named, click "Create".

Now, navigate to the Inbox tab or CRM tab and select a conversation or lead.

In the right sidebar, you will be able to access the Lists field. From there, select the newly created List to add the lead to it.

Once you've added leads to your List, you can easily check them out.

Return to the Lists tab, select your List, and all your leads will be waiting for you.
