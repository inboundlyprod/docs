A workspace is where all your Inboundly data lives, including inboxes, team members, leads, and more. You'll need to either join or create a workspace to start using Inboundly.

Let's go over the basics:

## Creating or Joining a Workspace

You can create a workspace by subscribing to a plan or join one through an invite. You'll see the option to Create a Workspace after creating an account and verifying your email.

The "Invitations" option will only appear if you've been invited to a workspace. Each user can only be part of one workspace at a time.

## Leaving a Workspace

To leave a workspace, go to the Settings tab, then click on "General," and select "Leave Workspace".

<Warning>Owners cannot leave their workspace - it must be deleted.</Warning>

## Deleting a Workspace

If you're the workspace owner, you can delete the workspace by going to the Settings tab, then click on "General," and select "Delete Workspace".

<Warning>Deleting a workspace will permanently delete all associated data with the account.</Warning>

Deleting the workspace does not affect your billing plan. If you wish to cancel Inboundly completely, unsubscribe before deleting the workspace. If you do not unsubscribe, you can create a new workspace.
