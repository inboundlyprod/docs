Team Roles allow you to limit team members' access to the functionalities they actually need. Here's a breakdown of what each Team Role provides access to:

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Owner">Owners have full access to the workspace and all of its functionalities. Owners are responsible for workspace billing.</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Admin">Admins have mostly full access, but have certain limitations compared to Owners. They cannot invite, kick, or demote other Admins. They cannot modify workspace settings such as changing the name, setting custom branding, or deleting it. Admins cannot generate API keys for integrations.</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Agent">Agents have read access to most of the workspace, but limited access to edit or update settings. They cannot invite, kick, or demote workspace members. They cannot create or modify CRM labels or Lists. They cannot update the default lead value, but they can set individual lead values. Agents cannot modify quick replies, but can use existing ones. This role is highly suitable for appointment setters.</Accordion>
