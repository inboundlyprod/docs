When you first start using our CRM, you'll notice the "Engaged" column, which serves as the default initial label for all incoming leads. In other words, this is the top of your funnel. It can't be removed or re-ordered.

You **can** change the name of the "Engaged" label so it aligns with your workflow.

You can also change the label type. If you change it to "Lead Value," you'll hide the opportunity score for your leads. More info on label types can be found [here](/crm/labels/create).
