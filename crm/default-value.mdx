Maintain consistency across your pipeline by updating the default lead value for your main offer.

To update the default lead value, go to the CRM tab and click on the gear icon. Select "Default Lead Value", change it to your preferred value, then click "Save".

All leads who **do not** have a manually set value will adopt this default value. If you **have** set a lead's value manually, changing the default value will not affect them

For example, if a lead's value was manually set to 100 dollars and the default value is changed to 200 dollars, the lead's value will remain at 100 dollars.
