To re-order labels, navigate to the CRM tab and click on the gear icon. Select "Reorder Labels".

Then, simply drag and drop the labels to the order you prefer. Once you've arranged the labels, click "Save" to apply the changes.

<Warning>You cannot change the order of the first column in your CRM, which is named "Engaged" by default. You **can** change its name and type - check out the [Getting Started](/crm/quickstart) guide for more details.</Warning>
