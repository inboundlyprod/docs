To delete a label, click the three dots beside its name. From the dropdown menu, select "Delete". Any leads in this label will be moved back to your first (default) column.

<Warning>You cannot remove the first column in your CRM, which is named "Engaged" by default. You **can** change its name and type - check out the [Getting Started](/crm/quickstart) guide for more details.</Warning>
