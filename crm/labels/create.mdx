Choose a **name** for your new label.

Then, choose a **label type**. There are 2 types of labels you can choose from:
<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Lead Value">This type of label will show the lead value (dollars) of the leads in the CRM. Leads in this label will have their opportunity score hidden everywhere.</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Opportunity Score">This type of label will show the opportunity score of the leads in the CRM. You will still be able to [see leads' values within conversations](/inbox/details/value).</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Once your new label has a name and a type, click "Create". Your label has now been added to your CRM, and it's ready to use!
