<Info>Each connected inbox (Twitter account) will have different lists.</Info>

## Viewing Your Lists

To view your lists, go to the Lists tab. Here, you'll find an overview of all lists associated with the current inbox.

If you have multiple lists, you can quickly search for one by its name or tag.

<video autoplay="true" muted="true" loop playsinline className="w-full aspect-video" src="/videos/guides_lists_search.mp4" />

## Viewing Leads In Lists

To see leads within a list, simply click on the list to open it.

<video autoplay="true" muted="true" loop playsinline className="w-full aspect-video" src="/videos/guides_lists_open.mp4" />

To find specific leads within a list, you can simply type the lead's X/Twitter name into the search bar.

<video autoplay="true" muted="true" loop playsinline className="w-full aspect-video" src="/videos/guides_list_details_search.mp4" />

You can also leverage the filter function to narrow down leads even further. If you select 2 different criteria to filter, it will only show leads that match both of these criteria.

<video autoplay="true" muted="true" loop playsinline className="w-full aspect-video" src="/videos/guides_list_details_filter.mp4" />

Here's what each filter means:
<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Current Label">Selecting a label here will filter leads based on the labels assigned to them. If you select multiple labels, it will show leads from either label selected.</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Value">Filter leads based on their assigned value. You can select leads whose value is above or below a certain value. Click the comparison criteria to change the type of filter.</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Opportunity Score">Filter leads based on their opportunity score. Similar to value, you can select leads whose opportunity score is above or below a certain value. Click the comparison criteria to change the type of filter.</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Contact Details">Filter leads based on available contact details such as name, email, or website. You can select multiple criteria, and it will show leads who have all selected contact details filled in.</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Last Interaction">Filter leads based on the timeframe of the last interaction. You can select leads with interactions in the past 24 hours, past 7 days, or past 30 days.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
