If you're logged in to multiple X/Twitter accounts already, make sure to switch to the one that you want to connect to Inboundly.

Back on Inboundly, head to the Settings tab. Use the sidebar to open "Inboxes". Click the "Connect Inbox" button and then "Authorize app" on the next page.

That's it! You'll now be able to manage your new inbox in Inboundly.
