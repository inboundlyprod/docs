<Note>Only Workspace Owners and Admins can connect inboxes to a workspace.</Note>

First, log in to your  X/Twitter account on the same device and browser you're using to set up Inboundly.

If you're logged in to multiple  X/Twitter accounts already, make sure to switch to the one that you want to connect to Inboundly.

## Messaging Tokens

In order to enable in-app messaging, you'll need to add your messaging tokens to Inboundly.

First, open an **incognito browser window** and log in to your X/Twitter account.

Once you're logged in, right-click the page and press "Inspect" (Chrome) or "Inspect Element" (Firefox). Locate the "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox).

In the "Cookies" list for "twitter.com", find the "auth_token" row and copy the "Cookie Value".

Paste the value you just copied into Inboundly.

Do the same thing for the "ct0" row, and hit "Save Changes".

That's it! You'll now be able to send messages with your X/Twitter account directly from Inboundly.
