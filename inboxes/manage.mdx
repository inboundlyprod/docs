<Note>Only Workspace Owners and Admins can manage connected inboxes.</Note>

On Inboundly, head to the Settings tab. Use the left sidebar to open "Inboxes".

On each connected inbox, you'll see options to either "Remove" or "Set Primary".

Your **primary inbox** is your default Inboundly inbox. This is the inbox that will load when you first sign in to your Inboundly dashboard.

To **remove an account**, simply press "Remove" and follow the instructions. When you remove a connected inbox, it will delete all data linked to that inbox. This includes all of your leads, labels, lists, follow-up reminders, quick replies, and more. Essentially, you will need to set up your inbox from scratch if you want to reconnect this account later.
